# ResNet50 on Habana Gaudi

The ResNet50 benchmark is sourced from the HabanaAI Model References Github Repo. https://github.com/HabanaAI/Model-References/README.md

We utilized Gaudi1 systems at AI testbeds within ALCF.

HabanaAI published optimized ResNet50 and BERT_large models for MLPERF3.1, which we have used in our paper; however, those models were not available on MLPERF4.0. Currently, they only have this model available https://github.com/HabanaAI/Model-References/PyTorch/computer_vision/classification/torchvision/README.md
