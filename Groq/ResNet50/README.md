# ResNet50 on Groq

The ResNet50 benchmark was sourced from Groqâ€™s private GitHub repository. We collaborated with Sanjif Shanmugavelu from Groq, who contributed to this work and is also a co-author of the paper.

We utilized Groq systems at [AI testbeds](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-ai-testbed) within ALCF.

Some results in the paper were directly provided by Sanjif, as we were unable to reproduce the performance numbers due to differences in the SDK version.
